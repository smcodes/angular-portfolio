# UI Library Scaffold

This folder will contain reusable UI primitives and composed components.

- atoms: small building blocks (button, input, badge, skeleton)
- molecules: component compositions (flight-card, fare-breakdown, seat-map)
- organisms: feature-level UI sections (search-panel, booking-summary)
